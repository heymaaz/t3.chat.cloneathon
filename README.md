# T3 Chat Clone Setup

A modern AI-powered chatbot with file search and web search.

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for dependency management. Install it globally if you don't have it.

## Self-hosting guide using local Convex

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cloneathalon
pnpm install
# We need node 18
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
# Start Convex locally
npx convex dev

The `dev` script spins up both the Vite frontend and Convex backend if you use convex (on cloud)

### Common scripts

- `pnpm dev` ‚Äì start the frontend and backend in development mode (if you use convex on cloud)
